<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<dt><b>Why using any Slider or Panel causes a huge Slowdown?</b></dt>
<dt>If your in this situation I recommend changing to Pigment.O Lite.</dt>
<dt>The most noticiable culprit for this situation is Linux's version of PyQt5 on how it handles Signals.</dt>
<br/>
<dt><b>Why do my Sliders have squares instead of triangle arrows?</b></dt>
<dt>Your lacking fonts on your OS.</dt>
<dt>For Linux users you need to install "Symbola Font".</dt>
<br/>
<dt><b>Why is Krita x color picker fighting against Pigment.O color?</b></dt>
<dt>In the Filters area there are some color pickers that have a different behaviour than when in the painting area.</dt>
<dt>To aid on this I made a ON/OFF switch to quickly disable Pigment.O as needed.</dt>
<br/>
<dt><b>Why does Krita periodicly stresses out every second with Pigment.O active?</b></dt>
<dt>The cause of that is Pigment.O's periodic pulse to check any color changes within Krita.</dt>
<dt>If your in this situation change the switch to "P>K" as it will disable Pigment.O's color check cycle and will only send color into Krita and never check color diferences with Krita.</dt>
<dt>Also you can go to the code and change the "check_timer" value to adjust or disable the check entirely.</dt>
<br/>
<dt><b>Why does Pigment.O change Color values right after I choose one?</b></dt>
<dt>This behaviour is certainly odd but ensures stability within Pigment.O's cyle, since it operates in multiple color spaces at the same time.</dt>
<dt>I will explain 2 cases where this happens in 8 bit depth scenario where it happens often.</dt>
<dt>Imagine your in RGB and you set the value 120.50 in the Red channel. This value does not really exist persay but exists within, since RGB works in integer values so what you acctually apply is the value 120 since that color ranges from 120.00 up too 120.99. After the color you choose is placed in Krita, Pigment.O checks the color that is currently active in Krita with it's periodical check and it reads 120, since 120.00 is different than 120.50 it adjusts itself to the current color changing the selected value.</dt>
<dt>The other case is when your working in another color space like HSV or HSL. What happens is similar but with a extra step. Imagine you set the HSV Color of (120,120,120), that is immediatley converted into RGB and applied to Krita, most conversions if not all will output a float value so what is applied is the integer value that contains it. For that reason after the check the RGB channels will round out all decimal values to zero and your HSV color will be set to corresponding color of (120,123.25,120).</dt>
<dt>Thus concluding that even though the value changes, it changes to the correct values of the color you choose in its containing color space and for the case of HSV and HSL they are containned by RGB.</dt>
<dt>It may feel weird but knowing why it does it, should improve confidence on it's behaviour.</dt>
<br/>
<dt><b>Why are there checkers just above the Sliders?</b></dt>
<dt>These squares are visual indicators of 10% increments.</dt>
<dt>While editing any value the percentage of that Slider will be displayed over the checkers.</dt>
<dt>Pressing Ctrl while editing the Slider will pin the cursor to these increments and the only noticiable exception is the HUE slide that instead goes in 60ยบ increments.</dt>
<br/>
<dt><b>Why does the UVD panel feel heavy to use?</b></dt>
<dt>Most of the lag consists on Polygon Shape change and also the Display Colors inside it, which corresponds to a difference in the Diagonal value.</dt>
<dt>For this reason Sliders and Color Blocks are faced with a small calculation period where everything inside Pigment.O is redrawn.</dt>
<dt>While selecting colors on the UVD panel there is no Diagonal variation making selecting colors much faster.</dt>
<dt>Also the bigger the Polygon Shape is the longer it will take to update the Display Colors, so having it a smaller size improves performance.</dt>
<dt>To avoid poor performance while painting, selecting colors outside Pigment.O update Polygon Shape and Cursor location but do not update it's Color Display, delegating that task to the Mouse Enter Event so the check cycle would not cause gaps in the paiting process however if you still feel it somehow switch to "P>K" mode.</dt>
<dt>Also after selecting a color on the UVD panel there is a small calculation time where it converts it to the RGB color and during this time there is no paint on the tip of the pen.</dt>
<dt>In short it does a alot of calculations to accomodate it's use and has everything going against it forcing many display sacrificies for better performance.</dt>
<br/>
<dt><b>Why can't I work with percentual values?</b></dt>
<dt>Well you acctually can, Pigment.O is acctually Agnostic over color scaling.</dt>
<br/>
<dt><b>What is that talk about Pigment.O being Agnostic?</b></dt>
<dt>Pigment.O is independant of any color scale on all color spaces.</dt>
<dt>Noticiable cases of need:</dt>
<dt>- Wanting to work in percentual values, from 0 to 100.</dt>
<dt>- HSV and HSL is a case where the color scale is wrong but works better as it is given. Normaly HSV/HSL is (360,100,100) unlike what is used (360,255,255) but the fact is that you loose more colors during conversions if you use the Standard.</dt>
<dt>- 16 bit integer color depth is a case where color ranges from 0 to 65535. Pigment.O is by default set to work on 8 bit so you need to change it if you want to work on higher bit depths.</dt>
<dt>- 16 and 32 bit float color depth is a case where it ranges from 0 to 1. This range is how Pigment.O works internally and then it is scalled up, but this range should not be used due to some widgets behaviour that mess up decimal values by rounding them out and so a 0 to 100 range should be used instead.</dt>
<dt>To use this hidden feature go to the code and you can change the variables (kritaAAA, kritaRGB, kritaHUE, kritaSVL, kritaCMYK) as needed.</dt>
<dt>This however will not affect the HEX color conversion unless explicity said by changing the variables (hexAAA, hexRGB, hexHUE, hexSVL, hexCMYK) however this is not recommended and is marked as such with "# DO NOT TOUCH !".</dt>
